            <p>
              From my earliest moments, I have always been passionate about
              animals, wildlife and the natural world around me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up, my childhood was graced with all sorts of interesting
              pets, each with their own unique requirements and behaviours to be
              studied, enrichment ideas created and needs cared for.
            </p>
            <p>
              My own hamsters, finches, aquarium and pond fish, terrapins and
              stick insects all taught me so much about caring for pets.
              However, while I wasn’t allowed them myself (my house was already
              resembling something of a small zoo), helping friends with their
              rabbits, cats and dogs and even ponies, widened my experiences
              further.
            </p>
            <p>
              If not ‘messing about with the animals again’, I would often be
              found outside tracking and studying the wildlife big and small and
              their fascinating ecosystems in the garden and woodland behind my
              home!

              Since being slightly more grown up, I have only very briefly been
              without an animal in my life, and how empty that short time was!
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing my passion for pets, many of our past and present furry,
              feathered or scaly family members have come to us as rescues or
              rehome, some as short term fosters, and others on a permanent
              basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The menagerie has since at various times over the years included
              different species of finches, budgies, cockatiels, a green cheeked
              conure, button quails, chickens, bearded dragons, terrapins and
              musk turtles, tortoises, a royal python snake, axolotls, mice,
              rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and of course our two very
              lovely dogs.

              Our Westie, Indiana Jones, came to us from a local rescue centre,
              and I experienced first-hand the behavioural difficulties that can
              be encountered in fully mature adult dogs due to lack of adequate
              socialisation, habituation and basic training as a young puppy.
              Studying and carefully and empathetically working through these
              challenging issues with Indi inspired me to become a positive
              reinforcement-based dog trainer. Indi is now a happy well-rounded
              little old lad.
