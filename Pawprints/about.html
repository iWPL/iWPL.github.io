              <p>
                From my earliest moments, I have always been passionate about
                animals, wildlife and the natural world around me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Growing up, my childhood was graced with all sorts of
                interesting pets, each with their own unique requirements and
                behaviours to be studied, enrichment ideas created and needs
                cared for.
              </p>
              <p>
                My own hamsters, finches, aquarium and pond fish, terrapins and
                stick insects all taught me very much, and although I wasn’t
                allowed them myself (my house was already resembling something
                of a small zoo), helping friends with their rabbits, cats and
                dogs and even ponies, widened my experiences further.
              </p>
              <p>
                If not ‘messing about with the animals again’, I would often be
                found outside tracking and studying the wildlife big and small
                and their fascinating ecosystems in the garden and woodland
                behind my home!

                Since being slightly more grown up, I have only very briefly been
          without an animal in my life, and how empty that short time was!
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing my passion for pets, many of our past and present furry,
          feathered or scaly family members have come to us as rescues or
          rehome, some as short term fosters, and others on a permanent basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                The menagerie has since at various times over the years included
          different species of finches, budgies, cockatiels, a green cheeked
          conure, button quails, chickens, bearded dragons, terrapins and musk
          turtles, tortoises, a royal python snake, axolotls, mice, rabbits,
          guinea pigs, chinchillas, and of course our two very lovely dogs.

          Our Westie, Indiana Jones, came to us from a local rescue centre, and
          I experienced first-hand the behavioural difficulties that can be
          encountered in fully mature adult dogs due to lack of adequate
          socialisation, habituation and basic training as a young puppy.
          Studying and carefully and empathetically working through these
          challenging issues with Indi inspired me to become a positive
          reinforcement-based dog trainer. Indi is now a happy well-rounded
          little old lad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a qualified Associate Puppy School Tutor, having completed the
          full Puppy School Tutor training course with Gwen Bailey, founder of
          Puppy School and renowned behaviourist. I have completed numerous
          training courses with the Institute of Modern Dog Trainers (IMDT), and
          am working on a Level 3 Diploma in Learning, Motivation and
          Reinforcement. I intend to apply for the IMDT membership assessment in
          due course. My first aid training for both humans and dogs is also
          kept up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having undergone a personal assessment process ensuring I meet their
          high standards, ethics and force and fear-free philosophy, I am proud
          to have been accepted as an approved Professional Member of the Pet
          Professional Network (PPN), which is the first international business
          support and educational platform for kind, ethical and trusted pet
          professionals. PPN are proud to work in collaboration with modern,
          world class training and behavioural institutes and associations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am of course fully insured, with Pet Business Insurance. So with a
          wealth of experience with a huge variety of pets, and being such an
          animal nerd, keen to keep on top of the latest scientific research and
          understanding of their needs, you can be confident your pet would be
          in safe hands with me at Pawprints!
